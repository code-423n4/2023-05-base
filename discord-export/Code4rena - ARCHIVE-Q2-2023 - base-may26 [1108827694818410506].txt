Hey @🐺wardens our apologies, but the BASE audit will be delayed until next week. This might be a great time to get KYC'd if you haven't already, and plan to participate.

how do the c4 findings interact with the immunefi bounty?


[06/01/2023 01:26] jes5_c
is everything also in scope for the immunefi one then? i don't think their "assets in scope" section includes the bedrock upgrades, maybe it needs to be updated. (sorry if this is off-topic!)


[06/01/2023 01:36] itsmetechjay
They don't interact - we just wanted to inform you. You would need to also submit findings to ImmuneFi in order to be eligible for those bounties.

Hi wardens! 

Wanted to share an update on this program: with the upcoming upgrade of Optimism to Bedrock, if you find a bug that’s relevant and in-scope for both @Code4rena’s audit and @OptimismFND’s @Immunefi’s bug bounty,  you can earn even more than our **$100k**  guaranteed:

 Up to **+$50k**  for non-theft vectors
** +$2m**  for loss of funds vectors

If you want to learn more about the Optimism program, you can here: https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/. If you find a critical bug, please also submit it directly to the Optimism program to ensure that we can review, reward, and resolve it as soon as possible.

the op-geth does not lock commit hash, so which version of the op-geth should we audit?

The Developers actually did a good one on this codebase.⚡️✅️

Congrats to everyone 👏👏🫡


[07/20/2023 00:04] thetechnofeak
what do u mean 'i got one too" you got it right?


[07/20/2023 00:05] thetechnofeak
all these high payouts yet no medium or high findings how??


[07/20/2023 00:07] thetechnofeak
so how do these QA things work ??


[07/20/2023 00:55] 0xrizwan
Congratulations Everyone. 🎉 🎉


[07/20/2023 01:20] Hama#9496
Really same, was the contest that secure or there d be a mistake in the judging?


[07/20/2023 01:22] ladboy233
I write a book during the post judging QA period lol


[07/20/2023 01:23] ladboy233
I think the sponsor and judge did thoroughly review the issue


[07/20/2023 01:23] ladboy233
and the judge takes extensively feedback


[07/20/2023 01:23] ladboy233
the judge is 0xLeastWood


[07/20/2023 01:23] ladboy233
the lead senior researcher in spearbitDAO, so I did repect his judgement and authority


[07/20/2023 01:23] ladboy233
So I think the contest is secure and very unlikely a mistake


[07/20/2023 02:08] victorygod

[07/20/2023 07:08] dwward3n
Did your medium become QA which got you 8k? Very interested to see the report


[07/20/2023 07:12] dwward3n
Was it about contacts or golang code?


[07/20/2023 08:52] thetechnofeak
what are QA reports, are they different from high /mediums


[07/20/2023 09:26] ihtishamsudo
A summary report of Low And Non Critical issues


[07/20/2023 09:42] thetechnofeak
ohhh where can i read the past reports of these ?? available on code4ren?


[07/20/2023 09:43] ihtishamsudo
go to code4rena homepage there will be past reports


[07/20/2023 09:46] ladboy233
if not QA then 80K lol, no but it is ok


[07/20/2023 09:47] ladboy233
It is natural to think our own finding is right, but need to see and learn from other perspective

I think it's over a week | while written that awards to be distributed within a week

Is there any issue?


[07/28/2023 22:11] liveactionllamac4
There was an error on my part with handing this off for distribution. It has been corrected now and awards should be sent in the next couple of business days (to those who have finished the certification process). So very sorry for the delay! 🙏

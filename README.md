# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor an audit

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _audit_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the contest) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Overview

Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.
It is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it‚Äôs a public good available to everyone.



# Scope
We are basing this contest on [`OP-monorepo`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/382d38b7d45bcbf73cb5e1e3f28cbd45d24e8a59)  and [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/commit/3fa9e812447af947c0208838453268a8ea33444b) 
These commit hashes will be considered as a code freeze for the purposes of this contest.

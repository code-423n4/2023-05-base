# Overview

Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users on-chain.
It is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure itâ€™s a public good available to everyone.

# Scope

The key components within the scope of the contest include:

- [`L1 Contracts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/382d38b7d45bcbf73cb5e1e3f28cbd45d24e8a59/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1)

- [`L2 Contracts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/382d38b7d45bcbf73cb5e1e3f28cbd45d24e8a59/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2)

- [`op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/382d38b7d45bcbf73cb5e1e3f28cbd45d24e8a59/op-node)

- [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)

We encourage participants to look for bugs in the following areas:

- Node vulnerabilities
- EVM equivalence vulnerabilities
- Bridge vulnerabilities
- Generic smart contract issues

## External repos

We are basing this contest on [`OP-monorepo`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/382d38b7d45bcbf73cb5e1e3f28cbd45d24e8a59) and [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/commit/3fa9e812447af947c0208838453268a8ea33444b).

These commit hashes will be considered as a code freeze for the purposes of this contest.

These repos were added as submodules to the contest's repo. To fetch them, please clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules` or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you haven't cloned with submodules.

| Role | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| L2 ProxyAdmin Owner | Can instantly upgrade all L2 contracts. |
| L1 ProxyAdmin Owner | Can instantly upgrade all L1 contracts. |
| Challenger | Can call `deleteL2Outputs()` in the event of fault. |
| MSD Controller | Controls the Migration SystemDictator contract. |
| System Config Owner | Can modify system config values. |
| Proposer | Can propose new L2 Outputs. |

# Assumptions & Roadmap features
    * Sequencer is centralized at the moment
    * Users cannot propose L2 blocks at the moment
    * No fault proofs at the moment
    * Contracts are upgradable
    * Proposer is assumed to always propose correct l2 values
    * Challenger is assumed to challenge only in case of a fault
    * Guardian is assumed to only pause if necessary, not for greifing other users
    * Batcher  is assumed to always propose correct batches

# Known Issues

*Previously known and documented risks will not be will not be accepted as valid findings. Please refer to previous audits, known issues, OP Spec and Assumptions and Roadmap features.

*There is an edge case in which ETH deposited to the OptimismPortal by a contract can be irrecoverably stranded:

When a deposit transaction fails to execute, the sender's account balance is still credited with the mint value. However, if the deposit's L1 sender is a contract, the tx.origin on L2 will be aliased, and this aliased address will receive the minted on L2. In general the contract on L1 will not be able to recover these funds.We have documented this risk and encourage users to take advantage of our CrossDomainMessenger contracts which provide additional safety measures.

*Deposit griefing by filling up the MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT

This issue is mitigated by PR 5064, which does not completely
resolve the issue but does increase the cost of a sustained griefing attack.
A more complete fix will require architectural changes.

*There are various 'foot guns' in the bridge which may arise from misconfiguring a token. Examples include:

Having both (or neither of) the local and remote tokens be OptimismMintable.
Tokens which dynamically alter the amount of a token held by an account, such as fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens.
To minimize complexity our bridge design does not try to prevent all forms of developer and user error.

*When running in non-archive mode op-geth has difficulty executing deep reorgs. We are working on a fix.
